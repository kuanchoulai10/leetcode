## Summary



| **Solution Approach** | **Explanation (1-minute)** | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Brute Force (Nested Loop) | Calculate the area for every possible pair of lines using nested loops. Keep track of the maximum area found. This approach is straightforward but inefficient. | $O(nÂ²)$: Double loop to check all pairs. | $O(1)$: Constant space for variables only. | 
| Two-pointer technique | Use two pointers, one at each end of the array, to represent the lines. Calculate the area and move the pointer with the shorter line inward to potentially find a larger area. Continue until the pointers meet. This approach is efficient and leverages the idea that a shorter line limits the maximum area. | $O(n)$: Single pass as we move pointers inward. | $O(1)$: Constant space with only two pointers. |
